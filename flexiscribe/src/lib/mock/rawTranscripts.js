[00:00:00] Good morning everyone. Today we will discuss periodic interrupts.
[00:02:15] An interrupt allows the processor to stop its current task.
[00:05:40] Timers are used to generate waveforms through compare match.
[00:12:30] Time measurement relies on capture registers.
[00:20:10] This concept is essential in embedded systems programming.

[00:00:00] Today we focus on data acquisition and control systems.
[00:04:25] Sensors convert physical signals into electrical data.
[00:09:10] The ADC processes analog sensor input.
[00:18:45] Actuators respond to processed data for control output.
[00:32:00] This pipeline is fundamental to automation systems.

[00:00:00] Digital logic is the foundation of computing systems.
[00:03:10] Logic gates implement Boolean algebra.
[00:07:45] Truth tables define logical behavior.
[00:14:20] Combinational and sequential circuits differ in memory usage.
[00:25:00] These concepts enable digital circuit design.
