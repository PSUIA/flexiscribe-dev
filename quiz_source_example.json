      "summary": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. This process occurs in chloroplasts using chlorophyll and involves two main stages: light-dependent reactions that produce ATP and NADPH, and light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) that use these products to synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth as it produces oxygen and serves as the foundation of most food chains.",
