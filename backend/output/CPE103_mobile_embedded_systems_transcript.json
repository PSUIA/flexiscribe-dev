    {
      "minute": 1,
      "timestamp": "10:00:08",
      "text": "Good morning class. Today we will focus on Mobile Embedded Systems. An embedded system is a specialized computing system designed to perform dedicated functions within a larger mechanical or electronic system. When we say mobile embedded, we mean these systems are portable and often battery-powered."
    },
    {
      "minute": 2,
      "timestamp": "10:01:12",
      "text": "Mobile embedded systems are everywhere — your smartphones, fitness trackers, GPS navigation devices, medical wearables, and even the ECU modules inside modern vehicles. They differ from general-purpose computers because they are optimized for specific tasks with strict constraints on power, size, and real-time performance."
    },
    {
      "minute": 3,
      "timestamp": "10:02:15",
      "text": "Let us talk about the hardware architecture first. A typical mobile embedded platform includes a microcontroller or application processor, volatile memory like SRAM or DRAM, non-volatile storage such as flash memory, and a variety of peripherals — sensors, radios, displays, and actuators."
    },
    {
      "minute": 4,
      "timestamp": "10:03:20",
      "text": "The processor choice is critical. ARM Cortex-M series microcontrollers are widely used in low-power wearables, while ARM Cortex-A series application processors power smartphones and tablets. More recently, RISC-V based processors have gained attention as an open-source alternative for embedded designs."
    },
    {
      "minute": 5,
      "timestamp": "10:04:25",
      "text": "Power management is arguably the most important constraint in mobile embedded systems. Since these devices run on batteries, every milliamp counts. Techniques like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, or DVFS, allow the processor to reduce clock speed and voltage when full performance is not needed, significantly extending battery life."
    },
    {
      "minute": 6,
      "timestamp": "10:05:30",
      "text": "Sleep modes are another essential power-saving mechanism. Most microcontrollers support multiple low-power states — idle mode, standby mode, and deep sleep. In deep sleep, only a real-time clock or an external interrupt can wake the processor, reducing current draw to just a few microamps."
    },
    {
      "minute": 7,
      "timestamp": "10:06:35",
      "text": "Now let us discuss the software side. Mobile embedded systems typically run either bare-metal firmware or a real-time operating system, known as an RTOS. Bare-metal means your code runs directly on the hardware without an OS layer. It gives you maximum control but makes multitasking difficult."
    },
    {
      "minute": 8,
      "timestamp": "10:07:40",
      "text": "An RTOS like FreeRTOS, Zephyr, or ARM Mbed OS provides task scheduling, inter-task communication, and timing guarantees. The key property of an RTOS is determinism — it guarantees that high-priority tasks will meet their deadlines. This is crucial for systems that need real-time responsiveness, such as medical devices or automotive controllers."
    },
    {
      "minute": 9,
      "timestamp": "10:08:45",
      "text": "Communication protocols are another major topic. Mobile embedded devices use protocols like Bluetooth Low Energy or BLE for short-range wireless, Wi-Fi for local networking, LoRa for long-range low-power communication, and cellular technologies like LTE-M and NB-IoT for wide-area connectivity."
    },
    {
      "minute": 10,
      "timestamp": "10:09:50",
      "text": "BLE deserves special attention because it is the backbone of most wearable and IoT devices. It operates in the 2.4 GHz band, uses very little power by transmitting short bursts of data, and supports a Generic Attribute Profile called GATT for defining data services and characteristics."
    },
    {
      "minute": 11,
      "timestamp": "10:10:55",
      "text": "Sensor integration is what makes mobile embedded systems truly intelligent. Common sensors include accelerometers and gyroscopes for motion tracking, GPS receivers for location, temperature and humidity sensors for environmental monitoring, and heart rate or SpO2 sensors for health applications."
    },
    {
      "minute": 12,
      "timestamp": "10:11:58",
      "text": "Sensor fusion is the process of combining data from multiple sensors to produce more accurate and reliable information than any single sensor alone. For example, an inertial measurement unit or IMU combines accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data using algorithms like the Kalman filter to estimate precise orientation."
    },
    {
      "minute": 13,
      "timestamp": "10:13:05",
      "text": "Let us now look at memory management. Mobile embedded systems have very limited memory — sometimes as little as 64 kilobytes of RAM. You must avoid dynamic memory allocation with malloc and free in production firmware because fragmentation can cause unpredictable failures. Instead, use static allocation or memory pools."
    },
    {
      "minute": 14,
      "timestamp": "10:14:10",
      "text": "Over-the-air or OTA firmware updates are essential for deployed mobile devices. A robust OTA system uses a dual-bank flash layout so the device can download a new firmware image into the secondary bank while continuing to run from the primary bank. If the update fails, the bootloader rolls back to the previous version."
    },
    {
      "minute": 15,
      "timestamp": "10:15:15",
      "text": "Security is increasingly critical. Mobile embedded systems are vulnerable to physical tampering, side-channel attacks, and wireless eavesdropping. Best practices include using hardware-based secure elements or TrustZone, encrypting communication with TLS, and implementing secure boot to verify firmware integrity before execution."
    },
    {
      "minute": 16,
      "timestamp": "10:16:20",
      "text": "To summarize today's lecture: mobile embedded systems are constrained devices optimized for specific tasks under tight power, memory, and real-time requirements. Key design considerations include processor selection, power management with DVFS and sleep modes, RTOS versus bare-metal firmware, wireless communication protocols especially BLE, sensor integration and fusion, memory management without dynamic allocation, OTA updates, and security hardening. In the next lecture we will do a hands-on lab with an ESP32 board running FreeRTOS."
