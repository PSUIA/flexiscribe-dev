  ],
  "notes": [
    "The four pillars are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. OOP organizes software around objects rather than functions.",
    "Encapsulation bundles data with methods and uses access specifiers (public, private, protected). Class members are private by default.",
    "Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only necessary features. Implemented using abstract classes with pure virtual functions.",
    "C++ supports single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance. Derived classes inherit from base classes.",
    "Runtime polymorphism uses virtual functions and dynamic binding. Function overloading and operator overloading provide compile-time polymorphism."
  ],
  "summary": "This lecture covered the four fundamental pillars of Object-Oriented Programming in C++: encapsulation (bundling data with methods using access specifiers), abstraction (hiding implementation using abstract classes), inheritance (deriving classes from base classes with multiple inheritance types), and polymorphism (achieving multiple forms through overloading and virtual functions). A practical example using a Shape class hierarchy demonstrated these concepts."
