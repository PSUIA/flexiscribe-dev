    {

      "timestamp": "00:00",
      "text": "Good morning everyone. Today we will be discussing the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming in C++. Object-Oriented Programming, or OOP, is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic."
    },
    {
      "index": 1,
      "timestamp": "01:00",
      "text": "The four main pillars of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Let us start with encapsulation. Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components."
    },
    {
      "index": 2,
      "timestamp": "02:00",
      "text": "In C++, we achieve encapsulation through access specifiers: public, private, and protected. By default, members of a class are private. This means they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class."
    },
    {
      "index": 3,
      "timestamp": "03:00",
      "text": "Now let us move on to abstraction. Abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. For example, when you drive a car, you do not need to understand how the internal combustion engine works."
    },
    {
      "index": 4,
      "timestamp": "04:00",
      "text": "In C++, abstraction is implemented using abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class contains at least one pure virtual function. A pure virtual function is declared by assigning zero to the function declaration."
    },
    {
      "index": 5,
      "timestamp": "05:00",
      "text": "The third pillar is inheritance. Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The class that inherits is called the derived class, and the class being inherited from is called the base class."
    },
    {
      "index": 6,
      "timestamp": "06:00",
      "text": "C++ supports multiple types of inheritance: single inheritance, multiple inheritance, multilevel inheritance, hierarchical inheritance, and hybrid inheritance. Single inheritance is when a derived class inherits from only one base class."
    },
    {
      "index": 7,
      "timestamp": "07:00",
      "text": "Finally, polymorphism. Polymorphism means having many forms. In C++, polymorphism is achieved through function overloading, operator overloading, and virtual functions. Runtime polymorphism uses virtual functions and dynamic binding."
    },
    {
      "index": 8,
      "timestamp": "08:00",
      "text": "Let me show you a quick example. Consider a base class called Shape with a virtual function called area. We can then create derived classes like Circle and Rectangle that override the area function with their own implementations."
    },
    {
      "index": 9,
      "timestamp": "09:00",
      "text": "That concludes our overview of the four pillars of OOP. For next class, please review chapters three and four of your textbook, and try implementing a simple class hierarchy using inheritance and polymorphism. Any questions?"
