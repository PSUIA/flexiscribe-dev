"""
utils.py

Purpose:
    Store helper functions that can be used across multiple modules.

Functions to implement:
    - chunk_text(text, max_length)
        - Split long text into smaller chunks for summarization
    - optional logging or progress reporting functions
    - optional text analysis helpers (e.g., word count, readability metrics)

Notes:
    - Keep functions general-purpose and reusable
    - Avoid adding core logic; only helpers
